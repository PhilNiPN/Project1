# Project1 - Energy consumption for a single household

In this project we will analyse the energy consumption of a single household. The data can be downloaded here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#

In the notebook 'Energy-comp-final' we discuss: Missing data, imputation methods, data explorations, feature engineering, Arima, Seasonal Arima and LSTM model.

The aim is to learn about time-series data and then use machine learning models to predict the energy consumption at a given time.
