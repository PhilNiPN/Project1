# Project1 - Energy consumption for a single household

In this project we will analyse the energy consumption of a single household. The data can be downloaded here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#

Currently the analysis is not completed thus I will refer you to the 'Energy-comsumption-analysis.ipynb' notebook to see the progress.

In the notebook we discuss: Missing data, imputation methods, data explorations, feature engineering, and model selection. More will be added as my analysis progresses.

When the analysis is completed, I plan to gather the relevant  parts in the 'Energy-comp-final-ipynb' and take a smaller subset of the data to learn the plotly package for interactive plots.
